This folder holds small import modules generated via ROBOT (MIREOT) for external ontologies referenced by PCDO.

Generated files (not committed by default):
- `imports/obi_import.owl` — selected OBI terms (e.g., OBI_0000066, OBI_0000070, OBI_0000747)
- `imports/iao_import.owl` — selected IAO terms (e.g., IAO_0000311, IAO_0000115)

Use the Makefile or `tooling/robot-build.sh` to build imports.
